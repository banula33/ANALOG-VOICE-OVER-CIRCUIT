#  Analog Voice-Over Circuit with Dual-Mode Functionality

This project demonstrates a fully analog implementation of a Voice-Over (Ducking) Circuit designed for efficient audio channel management. This specific version utilizes a streamlined approach focusing on amplitude detection without complex filtering, allowing for a robust and high-gain audio response.

 ## Key Features

### 🔄 Dual-Mode Priority Selection Toggle between a Direct Mic Mode for live announcements and a Recorded Playback Mode for pre-recorded loops or voices.

### 🎯 Channel Prioritization Automatically prioritizes the selected voice channel when an input is detected, ensuring background audio "ducks" seamlessly.

### ⚖️ Detection Threshold Adjustable detection threshold using the LM358 comparator to ensure precise activation based on voice intensity.

### 🔌 Purely Analog Design Developed entirely using basic analog components and ICs (LM386 & LM358), ensuring zero-latency signal processing without the need for microcontrollers or band-pass filters.

## ⚙️ Functionality

🔰 Input Mode Selection The signal path begins at the mode selector switch. This allows the user to choose the priority source: either a Direct Microphone signal or a Recorded Voice module, making the system versatile for both live and automated environments.

🔰 Pre-Amplifier (LM386) The selected voice signal is fed to an LM386 IC configured as a high-gain pre-amplifier. It boosts low-level signals to a level suitable for analysis by the subsequent control circuitry.

🔰 Peak Detector (LM358) One half of the LM358 Dual Op-Amp captures the amplitude of the voice signal. Using a specific RC timing constant ($R = 47k\Omega$ and $C = 10\mu F$), it provides a stable DC output that manages the "ducking" release time.

🔰 Comparator (LM358) The second half of the LM358 compares the peak value against a predetermined threshold set by a $10k\Omega$ potentiometer. It produces a high output when speech surpasses this threshold.

🔰 Switching & Mixing The comparator's output serves as the control signal to attenuate the background music channel instantly, allowing the priority voice channel to dominate the mix.

🔰 Main Amplifier (LM386) The final prioritized audio signal is amplified by the main LM386 power stage to drive an $8\Omega$ speaker clearly through a $220\mu F$ coupling capacitor.
